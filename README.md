# 🚁 AI-Powered Drone Delivery Optimization System

## 📌 Overview
This project designs an AI-powered drone delivery system that converts natural language orders into optimized delivery routes using Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) algorithms.

The system integrates LLM-based input processing with optimization logic to efficiently handle large-scale delivery operations.
